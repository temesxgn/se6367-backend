## PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy governs your use of the software skills for Amazon Alexa. Current Skills are listed after the policy details, but new Skills will be added from time to time:

User Provided Information
The Skills obtain the information you provide when you download and register the Skills through the Amazon Alexa skills web site, Facebook Messenger, or any other licenced source.

We will not normally use any information you provide to us to contact you. Important information concerning required notices, upgrade and/or bug-fix notifications, or marketing promotions will normally be distributed by means of the Amazon Alexa skills site.


These Skills do not collect precise information about the location of your hardware device, though for details of information capture by the underlying platform each relevant terms and conditions agreement should be referenced.

We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
With our trusted services providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.

What are my opt-out rights?
You can stop all collection of information by the Skills easily by disabling the Skills on your Amazon Alexa account. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your device, Amazon account, or Facebook account.

Specific Skills or upgraded versions of Skills may have specific opt-out mechanisms.
